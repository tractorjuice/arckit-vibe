> ⚠️ **Community-contributed command** — not part of the officially-maintained ArcKit baseline. Output should be reviewed by qualified CISO / BMI-liaison / Rechtsabteilung before reliance. Citations to BMI / A-SIT / EU regulations may lag the current text — verify against the source. Items marked `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` must be confirmed against the **current NISG text (idF BGBl. I Nr. 94/2025) and implementing ordinances** before external use — the legislation is recent and evolving.

You are helping an enterprise architect generate an **Austrian NISG Compliance Assessment** — the Austrian transposition of NIS2 (EU Directive 2022/2555). The Austrian Netz- und Informationssystemsicherheitsgesetz (NISG, BGBl. I Nr. 111/2018 idF BGBl. I Nr. 94/2025) extends NIS2 obligations with Austria-specific designation, reporting, and supervision rules. Run this after `/arckit:eu-nis2` to add Austrian obligations that go beyond the EU baseline.

## Instructions

> **Note**: Before generating, scan `projects/` for existing project directories. For each project, list all `ARC-*.md` artifacts, check `external/` for reference documents, and check `000-global/` for cross-project policies. If no external docs exist but they would improve output, ask the user.

### Step 0: Read existing artifacts from the project context

**MANDATORY** (warn if missing):

- **REQ** (Requirements) — Extract: security requirements (NFR-SEC-xxx), operational requirements, integration requirements (INT-xxx), sector and entity type information, criticality thresholds
  - If missing: proceed with user-provided entity description, but note that requirements analysis would strengthen the gap assessment

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):

- **NIS2** (EU NIS2 Assessment) — Extract: Annex I / Annex II classification, size threshold results, Article 21 ten-measure status, incident reporting baseline
  - If missing: warn that `/arckit:at-nisg` should be run after `/arckit:eu-nis2` for best results
- **RISK** (Risk Register) — Extract: existing security risks, supply chain risks, third-party risks, business continuity risks
- **SECD** (Secure by Design) — Extract: existing security controls, maturity assessments, security architecture decisions
- **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, 000-global) — Extract: security baseline, incident response principles, supply chain policy

**OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently):

- **ATDSG** (AT DSG Assessment) — Extract: overlap where security monitoring processes personal data
- **DORA** (DORA Assessment) — Extract: overlapping ICT resilience obligations if financial sector

### Step 0b: Read external documents and policies

- Read any **external documents** in `external/` — extract existing BMI / GovCERT / A-SIT correspondence, sector-specific designation letters, incident response plans, BCM plans, Sicherheitshandbuch excerpts
- Read any **global policies** in `000-global/policies/` — extract security policy, incident response policy, supplier security policy, BCM policy
- If BMI designation documents found, use them to pre-populate the Essential/Important status.

### Step 1: Identify or Create Project

Identify the target project from the hook context. If the project doesn't exist:

1. Use Glob to list `projects/*/` directories and find the highest `NNN-*` number
2. Calculate the next number (zero-padded to 3 digits)
3. Slugify the project name
4. Use the Write tool to create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/README.md`
5. Set `PROJECT_ID` and `PROJECT_PATH`

### Step 2: Read Source Artifacts

Read all documents from Step 0. Identify:

- Sector (NIS2 Annex I Essential / Annex II Important / out of scope)
- Organisation size (>250 employees / 50–250 / <50)
- Operation in Austria (seat, subsidiary, critical service delivery in AT)
- Sector-specific Austrian designation status (E-Control for energy, FMA for finance, BMSGPK for health, BMK for transport, RTR for digital infrastructure, BMI for federal public admin)
- Financial sector involvement (DORA overlap)

### Step 3: Template Reading

**Read the template** (with user override support):

- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/at-nisg-template.md` exists in the project root
- **If found**: Read the user's customized template
- **If not found**: Read `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/templates/at-nisg-template.md`

### Step 4: Entity Classification (Austrian specifics)

Before generating the assessment, determine entity classification:

**Annex I — Essential Entities** (NIS2 baseline, carried into NISG): Energy, Transport, Banking, Financial market infrastructure, Health, Drinking water, Wastewater, Digital infrastructure, ICT service management, Public administration, Space.

**Annex II — Important Entities** (NIS2 baseline): Postal/courier, Waste, Chemicals, Food, Manufacturing (medical devices, computers, transport), Digital providers, Research.

**Austrian additions or scope differences**:

- Austria may designate additional entities under NISG based on criticality assessment (§3 Abs. 4: Bundeskanzler can designate regardless of size threshold)
- Public-administration scope: Federal bodies in scope by default; Land-level bodies can opt in via Landeshauptmann declaration (§22 Abs. 5-6) — check whether the relevant Land has opted in
- Special regimes continue for previously designated Betreiber wesentlicher Dienste under NISG 2018 — entities designated under old §16 transition automatically; new Essential/Important classification applies from entry into force of BGBl. I Nr. 94/2025

**Size thresholds** (NIS2 carried into NISG):

- Essential Entity: sector-qualified AND (>250 employees OR >€50M revenue)
- Important Entity: sector-qualified AND (50–250 employees OR €10–50M revenue)
- Microenterprises may fall out of scope unless sector-specific designation applies

Show entity classification before generating the full document.

### Step 5: Generate NISG Assessment

**CRITICAL**: Use the **Write tool** to create the assessment document.

1. **Detect version**: Check for existing `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ATNISG-v*.md` files:
   - No existing file → VERSION="1.0"
   - Existing file → minor increment if refreshed, major if scope changed

2. **Auto-populate Document Control**:
   - Document ID: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ATNISG-v{VERSION}`
   - Status: DRAFT
   - Created Date: {current_date}
   - Next Review Date: {current_date + 12 months}
   - Entity Designation: from Step 4 classification
   - Note: "This document supplements ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-NIS2-v*.md with Austrian-specific NISG 2024 obligations"

3. **Section 1: Austrian Scope and Designation**
   - Sector classification with AT sectoral authority mapping (E-Control, FMA, ELGA/BMSGPK, BMK for transport, etc.) `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]`
   - Entity designation: Essential / Important / Out of scope under NISG
   - Previous NISG 2018 designation (Betreiber wesentlicher Dienste) and transition status
   - Cross-border operations treatment (main establishment rules from NIS2)
   - Federal vs Land competence — confirm venue for supervision `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]`

4. **Section 2: Governance (NIS2 Art. 20 — as transposed)**
   - Geschäftsleitung (management body) approval of security measures
   - Management body personal liability for non-compliance — AT practice `[NEEDS VERIFICATION: confirm penalty regime in NISG 2024]`
   - Management body cybersecurity training requirement
   - Compliance status for each obligation

5. **Section 3: Risk Management Measures (NIS2 Art. 21 — as transposed)**
   - All ten minimum security measures with current status and gaps:
     1. Risk analysis policy
     2. Incident handling
     3. Business continuity / BCM
     4. Supply chain security
     5. Secure acquisition, development, maintenance
     6. Policies to assess effectiveness
     7. Cyber hygiene and training
     8. Cryptography policy
     9. HR security and access control
     10. MFA and secure communications
   - A-SIT guidance alignment where applicable (A-SIT publishes sector-agnostic security guidance; not a regulatory body but commonly referenced by BMI and sectoral authorities)
   - Proportionality assessment: measures proportionate to entity size and risk
   - Extract existing controls from SECD artifact to pre-populate status

6. **Section 4: Incident Reporting — Austrian Channel**
   - Three-tier CERT reporting: **Sectoral CERT** (if designated, e.g. Energy-CERT) → **National CERT** (CERT.at, operative under BMI §5) → **GovCERT** (BKA §4(4), public-admin entities only). Non-public entities report to CERT.at / sectoral CERT; GovCERT handles federal and Land public-admin entities
   - Four-stage NIS2 reporting timeline (24h early warning, 72h notification, intermediate on request, 1-month final report)
   - Austrian form and language requirements for reports
   - Cross-reporting to DSB if personal data breach (Art. 33 GDPR + NISG)
   - Tabletop / exercise expectations from BMI (§25 Cyberkrise exercises; BMI coordinates nationally)

7. **Section 5: Supply Chain Security**
   - Supplier inventory and risk assessment requirements
   - Contractual security clause requirements
   - Software supply chain requirements
   - ENISA supply chain framework plus AT-specific sectoral guidance (e.g. E-Control Verordnungen for energy sector, FMA Rundschreiben for financial sector)
   - EU coordinated risk assessment outcomes (5G, high-risk vendors)

8. **Section 6: Business Continuity and Resilience**
   - BCP documentation status
   - Backup and restoration testing
   - Crisis management procedures
   - RTO / RPO definition aligned with sectoral criticality expectations

9. **Section 7: Supervision, Inspections, and Penalties**
   - Supervisory regime: BMI / competent sectoral authority inspections
   - Ex ante (Essential) vs ex post (Important) supervision posture
   - Maximum penalties — NIS2 Art. 34 floor: Essential ≥ €10,000,000 or 2% worldwide annual turnover; Important ≥ €7,000,000 or 1.4% worldwide annual turnover (old NISG §26 €50K/€100K replaced by 2025 amendment)
   - Right to be heard / appeals (BVwG pathway)
   - Responsible entities for internal governance (CISO / Sicherheitsbeauftragter designation)

10. **Section 8: KSÖ and National Cyber Coordination** *(informational)*
    - KSÖ (Kuratorium Sicheres Österreich) as national PPP forum — voluntary but influential
    - NCSC-AT (part of BKA) / GovCERT (BKA §4(4)) — strategic coordination and public-admin CERT; BMI (§5-6) — operative CERT.at, SPOC toward EU, and enforcement authority
    - Participation options and information-sharing expectations

11. **Section 9: Gap Analysis and Roadmap**
    - Domain maturity matrix (L1–L5 scale)
    - Priority actions with effort estimates
    - Mermaid Gantt roadmap (0–3 months immediate, 3–6 months short-term, 6–12 months medium-term)
    - Related frameworks crosswalk (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, ISO 22301, BSI IT-Grundschutz — commonly used in AT)

Before writing the file, read `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/references/quality-checklist.md` and verify all **Common Checks** pass.

Write the document to:

## Important Notes

- **Run after eu-nis2**: This command adds the Austrian layer. For best results, run `/arckit:eu-nis2` first.
- **NISG amendment is recent**: The NIS2 transposition (BGBl. I Nr. 94/2025) is recent. Implementing ordinances (Verordnungen) from sectoral regulators may still be forthcoming. An AT cyber practitioner must confirm before external reliance.
- **Management body liability**: NIS2 Art. 20 makes Geschäftsleitung personally liable for approving and overseeing cybersecurity measures. Under the 2025 NISG amendment, management bodies must complete cybersecurity training. Penalties for entities: Essential ≥ €10M / 2% turnover, Important ≥ €7M / 1.4% turnover (NIS2 Art. 34 floor).
- **24-hour reporting capability**: The 24-hour early warning window is tight. Flag if no 24/7 incident detection and reporting capability exists.
- **KSÖ is voluntary but strategic**: Participation in Kuratorium Sicheres Österreich is not a legal obligation, but it is the main national PPP forum and is often expected of designated entities.
- **DORA overlap for financial sector**: Austrian financial entities face both NISG and DORA. Use `/arckit:eu-dora` to map the overlap; DORA generally takes precedence for ICT resilience obligations.
- **Use Write Tool**: NISG assessments cover 9 sections with technical and regulatory depth. Always use the Write tool.

## Suggested Next Steps

After completing this command, consider running:

- `/arckit-eu-nis2` -- Run the pan-EU NIS2 baseline first if not already completed *(when No prior eu-nis2 assessment exists for this project)*
- `/arckit-at-dsgvo` -- Assess AT DSG obligations where NISG processing involves personal data *(when Security monitoring processes personal data (logs, user activity))*
- `/arckit-risk` -- Integrate NISG gap findings into the project risk register
- `/arckit-secure` -- Implement security controls addressing NISG / NIS2 Article 21 ten minimum measures
