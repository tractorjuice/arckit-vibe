> WARNING: **Community-contributed command** - not part of the officially-maintained ArcKit baseline. Output should be reviewed by qualified legal, regulatory, cyber security, and operational risk advisers before reliance. SOCI obligations vary by asset class and regulator - verify the current Act, Rules, regulator guidance, and entity-specific obligations before external use.

You are an enterprise architect generating a **Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (SOCI Act) / Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Program (CIRMP) governance and evidence pack** for an Australian critical infrastructure asset or potentially regulated entity.

## Context

SOCI is a cross-sector Australian critical-infrastructure regime, not an energy-only obligation. It applies across eleven sectors and may require responsible entities to register assets, report incidents, adopt and comply with a written risk management program, submit annual reports, and protect sensitive SOCI information. This command provides general SOCI/CIRMP support for the AU community overlay; sector recipes such as `au-energy` should consume this artefact and add sector-specific obligations separately.

## Process

1. Read prerequisites:
   - `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` if present.
   - The project's REQ artefact - extract service criticality, asset class, sector, data, cyber, personnel, supply-chain, physical, and continuity obligations.
   - The project's STKE artefact - identify responsible entity, accountable officer, board/council/governing body, regulator, operational owner, cyber owner, suppliers, and asset operators.
   - The project's DIAG artefacts (`ARC-{P}-DIAG-*`) - extract deployment zones, critical components, interfaces, third parties, trust boundaries, and support dependencies.
   - The project's DFD artefacts (`ARC-{P}-DFD-*`) - extract protected information flows, operational data flows, external entities, data stores, and reporting pathways.
   - The project's DATA artefact (`ARC-{P}-DATA-v*`) - extract protected information, personal information, critical operational data, entity owners, retention, and classification.
   - The project's E8 posture artefact (`ARC-{P}-AUE8-v*`) if available.
   - The project's ISM applicability artefact (`ARC-{P}-AUISM-v*`) if available.
   - The project's PIA artefact (`ARC-{P}-AUPIA-v*`) if available.
   - The project's NDB playbook (`ARC-{P}-AUNDB-v*`) if available.
   - The project's OT security artefact (`ARC-{P}-AUOT-v*`) if available and the asset includes OT.
   - The project's ServiceNow artefact (`ARC-{P}-SNOW-v*`) if available - extract CMDB CIs, service dependencies, support groups, SLAs, incident queues, and change controls.
   - The project's RISK artefact if available.
   - The project's TRAC artefact if available.
   - The project's maturity-model artefact if available.
   - `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/templates/_partials/RENDERING.md`

2. Read the template:
   - First: `.arckit/templates-custom/au-soci-cirmp-template.md` (user override)
   - Then: `.arckit/templates/au-soci-cirmp-template.md`
   - Fallback: `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/templates/au-soci-cirmp-template.md`

3. Use `scripts/bash/create-project.sh --json <project-name>` if the project does not yet exist.

4. Use `scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh <PROJECT_ID> AUSOCI --filename` for the artefact filename.

5. Resolve the `<!-- DOC-CONTROL-HEADER -->` marker per `RENDERING.md`. Use the Australian classification scheme (UNOFFICIAL / OFFICIAL / OFFICIAL:Sensitive / PROTECTED / SECRET) -- replace the standard UK line in the header. Note that SOCI protected information is not the same as PSPF PROTECTED classification; document both where relevant.

6. Generate the following sections:

   - **Critical Asset and Responsible Entity Context** - identify the asset, sector, responsible entity, operator, direct interest holders, regulator, and whether the asset is declared or suspected in scope.

   - **SOCI Applicability Assessment** - assess sector, asset class, thresholds, responsible entity obligations, register obligations, incident reporting, government assistance implications, and any uncertainty requiring legal confirmation.

   - **ArcKit Architecture and Data Evidence Map** - cross-reference `/arckit:diagram`, `/arckit:dfd`, and `/arckit:data-model` artefacts to asset scope, protected-information handling, operational dependencies, and hazard evidence. Call out missing or stale evidence explicitly.

   - **CIRMP Governance Model** - document accountable owner, board/council/governing body oversight, annual report owner, risk committee, review cadence, and evidence repository.

   - **CIRMP Hazard Domain Assessment** - assess cyber and information security, personnel, supply chain, physical security, and natural hazards. Include material risk, relevant impact, current controls, evidence, gaps, and risk owner.

   - **Cyber and Information Security Evidence** - consolidate evidence from AUE8, AUISM, AUOT where applicable, AUPIA, AUNDB, monitoring, incident response, supplier access, and protected-information handling.

   - **Personnel, Supply Chain, Physical Security, and Natural Hazard Evidence** - capture responsible controls, suppliers, critical workers, physical critical components, facility controls, dependencies, and business continuity evidence.

   - **Incident Reporting and Notification Pathways** - document cyber incident escalation, responsible reporting roles, 12-hour / 72-hour pathways where applicable, regulator contact points, and record-keeping.

   - **Annual Report and Attestation Readiness** - assess whether the entity can produce the annual CIRMP report within required timeframes, with board/council/governing body approval.

   - **Operations, CMDB, and Traceability Integration** - map critical components and support processes to `/arckit:servicenow` CMDB CIs; map obligations and material risks to `/arckit:risk`, `/arckit:traceability`, `/arckit:graph-report`, and `/arckit:maturity-model` outputs.

   - **Cross-Sector vs Sector-Specific Obligations** - record general SOCI obligations here and explicitly defer sector-specific requirements such as AESCSF, AER ring-fencing, NER/NGR, or AEMO obligations to sector recipes.

   - **Recommendations** - prioritised actions grouped by Immediate, 30-90 days, 90-180 days, and strategic uplift.

7. Populate the External References section per `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/references/citation-instructions.md`. The SOCI Act, current CIRMP Rules / regulator guidance, and verification date MUST appear in the Document Register.

8. Write the artefact via the Write tool to `projects/<project-id>/<filename>`.

9. Show only a summary to the user: likely SOCI applicability position, CIRMP readiness, top material risks, and immediate evidence gaps.

## Important Notes

- This command provides general SOCI/CIRMP support. Do not include AESCSF, AER, NER/NGR, AEMO, or other sector-specialised obligations here except as future sector overlay references.
- SOCI protected information is legally sensitive and is different from PSPF PROTECTED classification. Flag protected-information handling requirements explicitly.
- Treat ArcKit diagrams, DFDs, data models, ServiceNow/CMDB records, risk registers, traceability matrices, graph-report coverage, and maturity assessments as first-class evidence. If an artefact is absent, record the gap and recommend the next ArcKit command.
- CIRMP obligations and rules are subject to amendments and may vary by asset class. Record the legislation and guidance version checked.
- The annual report is a governance obligation, not only a cyber artefact. Board/council/governing body approval readiness must be assessed.
- Where the asset includes OT, cross-reference `/arckit:au-ot-security`; where it does not, mark OT evidence as not applicable rather than forcing it into scope.

## Suggested Next Steps

After completing this command, consider running:

- `/arckit-diagram` -- Architecture diagrams identify critical components, boundaries, deployment zones, third parties, and operational dependencies that inform asset scope.
- `/arckit-dfd` -- DFDs identify data stores, cross-boundary flows, protected-information handling, and incident-reporting evidence paths.
- `/arckit-data-model` -- Data model evidence identifies protected information, personal information, critical operational data, retention rules, and data owners.
- `/arckit-au-e8-posture` -- Essential Eight posture supports cyber and information security hazard evidence.
- `/arckit-au-ism-controls` -- ISM applicability provides broader technical control evidence for SOCI cyber hazards.
- `/arckit-au-ot-security` -- OT security findings support CIRMP cyber hazard treatment where the critical asset includes connected OT.
- `/arckit-au-pia` -- Privacy impact findings support information security and protected-information handling.
- `/arckit-au-ndb-playbook` -- NDB incident response evidence supports notification and escalation pathways where personal information is involved.
- `/arckit-servicenow` -- ServiceNow/CMDB evidence supports critical component ownership, dependency, incident, change, and service-continuity controls.
- `/arckit-risk` -- CIRMP material risks and residual risks should feed the project risk register.
- `/arckit-traceability` -- CIRMP obligations and material risks should trace to requirements, evidence artefacts, owners, controls, and reporting actions.
- `/arckit-maturity-model` -- Use CIRMP findings to assess governance and operational maturity across cyber, personnel, supply chain, physical, and natural hazards.
- `/arckit-graph-report` -- Graph reporting should show AUSOCI coverage alongside AU compliance, architecture, risk, traceability, and operations artefacts.
