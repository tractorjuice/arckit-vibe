---

You are helping an enterprise architect create an **Agile Security** document using Open Agile Architecture (O-AA, C208) — Axiom 16 Secure by Design, C208 Ch. 4.6, and the O-AA Security Playbook (G216). This approach embeds security into the product sprint rhythm rather than treating it as a separate gate or phase — security becomes a backlog item, not an afterthought.

## User Input

```text
${args}
```

## Trigger Guidance

Use this command when **any** of the following conditions are met:

- Client wants **security embedded in sprint rhythm** rather than separate security phases

- Product requires **continuous compliance evidence** generated alongside development artifacts

- **Threat modeling** needs to be a backlog item, not a one-time activity

- Client operates in regulated environments (APRA, GDPR, APP, AI Act) with **sprint-aligned compliance**

- Product involves AI/ML systems requiring **algorithmic transparency and bias assessment** per sprint

**Do NOT use** when:

- Client requires traditional security audit with separate audit phases — use full TOGAF ADM with dedicated security phase

- Multi-year security programme with 50+ review gates outside sprint cadence

- Client needs standalone penetration testing or security assessment (use dedicated security tools instead)

## Prerequisites: Read Foundational Artifacts

> **Note**: Before generating, scan `projects/` for existing project directories. For each project, list all `ARC-*.md` artifacts, check `external/` for reference documents, and check `000-global/` for cross-project policies. If no external docs exist but they would improve output, ask the user.

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):

- **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in 000-global) — Extract: Security principles, compliance requirements, data classification standards

  - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:principles` first

- **OAPR** (Agile Product Architecture) — Extract: Product mission, guardrails, technology constraints

  - If missing: note that product architecture context is limited

- **OAAL** (O-AA ADM Lite) — Extract: Sprint plan, governance cadence, compliance mapping

  - If missing: note that O-AA Lite context is not available

- **OASTR** (Agile Strategy Canvas) — Extract: Risk profile, transformation risks, security strategy

  - If missing: note that strategy context is limited

### Prerequisites 1b: Read external documents and policies

- Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract security policies, compliance requirements, threat models, regulatory obligations

- Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract security standards, data classification policies, incident response procedures

## Instructions

### 1. Identify or Create Project

Identify the target project from the hook context. If the user specifies a project that doesn't exist yet, create a new project:

1. Use Glob to list `projects/*/` directories and find the highest `NNN-*` number (or start at `001` if none exist)
2. Calculate the next number (zero-padded to 3 digits, e.g., `002`)
3. Slugify the project name (lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with hyphens, trim)
4. Use the Write tool to create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/README.md` with the project name, ID, and date
5. Also create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/external/README.md` with a note to place external reference documents here
6. Set `PROJECT_ID` = the 3-digit number, `PROJECT_PATH` = the new directory path

### 2. Read Template

**Read the template** (with user override support):

- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates-custom/agile-security-template.md` exists in the project root

- **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)

- **If not found**: Read `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/templates/agile-security-template.md` (default)

- **Then**, read `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/templates/_partials/RENDERING.md` and resolve the template's `<!-- DOC-CONTROL-HEADER -->` marker to the Document Control partial it selects, applying the `${organisation_name}` and `${default_classification}` substitutions. Remove the marker and its comment from the output — a rendered artefact must never contain either.

- **Also** apply the O-AA placeholder substitutions in `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/references/placeholder-substitutions.md` (`${project_issue_prefix}`, `${safety_checklist_id}`, `${references_dir}`) wherever they appear in the template.

> **Tip**: Users can customise templates with `/arckit:customize agile-security`

### 3. O-AA Agile Security Framework

O-AA agile security practice (C208 Axiom 16, Ch. 4.6, G216) establishes that:

- **Security as backlog items**: Security work enters the product backlog as epics/features/stories — not a separate security workstream

- **Sprint-aligned compliance**: Compliance evidence is generated continuously alongside development artifacts, not accumulated for end-of-phase audits

- **Threat modeling per sprint**: Each sprint cycle includes threat model updates as a backlog item, not a one-time activity at project start

- **O-AA Axiom 16 (Secure by Design)**: security controls are designed into the product from Sprint 0, proportional to product risk — not bolted on at a compliance checkpoint

- **Shared security ownership**: Security is the team's responsibility, not a dedicated security team's gate

### 4. Shared Artefact Definitions

The agile security command defines artefacts whose structure is inlined in `agile-security-template.md`:

- **`security-backlog.yaml`** — security epics, stories, and sprint capacity allocation

- **`threat-model.yaml`** — per-sprint threat model (STRIDE or equivalent)

- **`compliance-evidence.yaml`** — sprint compliance evidence, always current

- **`vision.yaml`** — architecture vision security constraints (inherited from `/arckit:oaa-adm-lite`)

### 5. Generate Agile Security Document

Create the Agile Security document following the template structure.

#### Document Control

- Generate Document ID with `node scripts/generate-document-id.mjs {P} OASEC --filename` (canonical form: `ARC-{P}-OASEC-v1.0`)

- Set owner, dates, status, classification

- Review cycle: Per sprint cycle

#### Security Backlog Integration

- **Security epic categories**: Data protection, authentication/authorization, encryption, monitoring/observability, incident response, compliance reporting

- **Sprint capacity**: Target 20-30% of sprint capacity for security items (adjust based on risk profile)

- **Security story format**: "As a [role], I want [security control] so that [threat mitigated]"

- **Acceptance criteria**: Each security story includes testable security acceptance criteria

#### Threat Modeling per Sprint

- **Sprint 0 threat model**: Initial threat model covering product architecture (STRIDE or equivalent)

- **Sprint N threat updates**: Each sprint updates threat model based on new features, identified vulnerabilities, and environment changes

- **Threat model as backlog item**: "Update threat model for Sprint N features" enters backlog each sprint

- **Automated threat detection**: Integration with SAST/DAST tools feeding threat model updates

#### Compliance Evidence per Sprint

- **Evidence generation**: Compliance evidence artifacts generated alongside feature development

- **Regulatory mapping**: Map sprint deliverables to regulatory requirements (GDPR, APRA, APP, AI Act)

- **Continuous evidence**: Evidence is never accumulated for audits — it's always current

- **Evidence structure**: Standardized evidence format per sprint, inlined in `agile-security-template.md`

#### Security Architecture Guardrails

- **Non-negotiable constraints**: Data encryption at rest/in transit, authentication requirements, logging standards

- **Technology standards**: Approved security building blocks and libraries

- **Anti-patterns**: Forbidden security approaches (e.g., rolling your own crypto, hardcoded credentials)

- **Security review gates**: Lightweight sprint-level security reviews, not heavy-gate audits

#### AI/ML Security Considerations

- **Algorithmic transparency**: ATRS compliance per sprint for AI/ML features

- **Bias and fairness**: Automated bias testing in sprint CI/CD pipeline

- **Model security**: Model poisoning, data leakage, and adversarial attack mitigations

- **Privacy preservation**: Differential privacy, federated learning where applicable

### 6. External References

Populate the `## External References` section per `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/references/citation-instructions.md`. Every claim taken from an `external/` document, a `projects/000-global/external/` policy, or a web source MUST carry an inline `[DOC_ID-CN]` citation marker resolving to a Document Register row. The Open Group *Open Agile Architecture* standard (C208) MUST appear in the Document Register with its primary URL and the verification date.

### 7. Quality Gate

Before writing the file, read `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/references/quality-checklist.md` and verify all **Common Checks** plus the **OASEC** per-type checks pass. Fix any failures before proceeding.

### 8. Write the Document

**IMPORTANT**: The Agile Security document will be a substantial document (typically 180-300 lines). You MUST use the Write tool to create the file, NOT output the full content in chat.

Create the file at:

```text
projects/{P}/ARC-{P}-OASEC-v1.0.md
```

### 9. Show Summary to User

After writing the file, show a concise summary (NOT the full document):

```markdown
## Agile Security Document Created

**Document**: `projects/{P}/ARC-{P}-OASEC-v1.0.md`
**Document ID**: ARC-{P}-OASEC-v1.0

```

## Important Notes

1. **Security as Backlog Items**: Security is not a phase or gate in O-AA. It's backlog items that compete with feature work for sprint capacity. The team decides security priority alongside feature priority.

2. **Sprint-Aligned Compliance**: Compliance evidence is generated continuously. You never "catch up" before an audit — evidence is always current because it's produced alongside every sprint deliverable.

3. **Threat Modeling is Living**: The threat model updates each sprint. It's not a document you write once at project start. New features create new attack surfaces.

4. **Sprint Artefacts**: The `security-backlog.yaml`, `threat-model.yaml`, and `compliance-evidence.yaml` structures are defined inline in `agile-security-template.md`. Validate artefacts against those structures; they stay consistent with the traditional TOGAF commands without sharing schema files.

5. **Use Write Tool**: The Agile Security document is typically 180-300 lines. ALWAYS use the Write tool to create it.

6. **Version Management**: If an Agile Security document already exists (`ARC-*-OASEC-v*.md`), create a new version (v2.0) rather than overwriting.

7. **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji.

## Suggested Next Steps

After completing this command, consider running:

- `/arckit-agile-governance` -- Establish governance cadence including security review gates
- `/arckit-agile-strategy` -- Align security strategy with dual transformation tracks
