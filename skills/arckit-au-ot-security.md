## Context

ASD operational technology guidance is reusable beyond any one industry sector. It applies to government and critical-infrastructure environments where cyber compromise can affect safety, availability, physical processes, public services, environmental outcomes, or operational continuity. This command complements the Australian Essential Eight and ISM artefacts: E8 and ISM provide the security-control foundation, while this artefact applies OT-specific architecture, connectivity, and safety constraints.

## Process

1. Read prerequisites:
   - `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` if present.
   - The project's REQ artefact - extract OT, availability, safety, remote access, supplier access, resilience, and regulatory requirements.
   - The project's STKE artefact - identify operational owner, safety owner, control-system owner, CISO, managed-service providers, and suppliers.
   - The project's DIAG artefacts (`ARC-{P}-DIAG-*`) - extract context, container, deployment, trust-boundary, and network-zone evidence.
   - The project's DFD artefacts (`ARC-{P}-DFD-*`) - extract OT data flows, protocols, stores, ingress/egress paths, and cross-boundary transfers.
   - The project's DATA artefact (`ARC-{P}-DATA-v*`) - extract OT asset, telemetry, event, configuration, maintenance, and personal-information entities.
   - The project's E8 posture artefact (`ARC-{P}-AUE8-v*`) if available.
   - The project's ISM applicability artefact (`ARC-{P}-AUISM-v*`) if available.
   - The project's ServiceNow artefact (`ARC-{P}-SNOW-v*`) if available - extract CMDB CIs, ownership, support groups, SLAs, and incident/change workflows.
   - The project's RISK artefact if available.
   - The project's TRAC artefact if available.
   - The project's maturity-model artefact if available.
   - `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/templates/_partials/RENDERING.md`

2. Read the template:
   - First: `.arckit/templates-custom/au-ot-security-template.md` (user override)
   - Then: `.arckit/templates/au-ot-security-template.md`
   - Fallback: `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/templates/au-ot-security-template.md`

3. Use `scripts/bash/create-project.sh --json <project-name>` if the project does not yet exist.

4. Use `scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh <PROJECT_ID> AUOT --filename` for the artefact filename.

5. Resolve the `<!-- DOC-CONTROL-HEADER -->` marker per `RENDERING.md`. Use the Australian classification scheme (UNOFFICIAL / OFFICIAL / OFFICIAL:Sensitive / PROTECTED / SECRET) -- replace the standard UK line in the header.

6. Generate the following sections:

   - **OT Environment Context** - system name, operational function, safety impact, availability requirements, OT/IT boundary, third-party access, classification, and critical-infrastructure relevance.

   - **ASD OT Guidance Alignment** - assess the project against ASD OT principles, definitive OT architecture guidance, secure connectivity principles, and AI-in-OT principles if AI is in scope.

   - **Definitive OT Architecture View** - record whether the organisation has an authoritative view of OT assets, data flows, trust boundaries, dependencies, owners, and connectivity paths.

   - **ArcKit Architecture Evidence Map** - cross-reference `/arckit:diagram`, `/arckit:dfd`, and `/arckit:data-model` artefacts to each OT zone, data flow, asset class, and control boundary. Call out missing diagrams, missing DFD levels, stale data entities, or unowned dependencies as evidence gaps.

   - **IT/OT Segmentation and Trust Boundaries** - document zones, conduits, boundary controls, admin pathways, jump hosts, protocol gateways, DMZs, and monitoring points.

   - **Secure Connectivity and Remote Access** - assess business case, exposure, inbound connectivity, brokered access, just-in-time access, privileged access workstations, vendor access, obsolete device compensating controls, and logging.

   - **Supplier and Managed-Service Access** - document suppliers, managed-service providers, support paths, privileged access, contractual controls, and evidence review cadence.

   - **Monitoring, Logging, and Incident Response** - assess OT logging coverage, SOC integration, safety escalation paths, isolation options, recovery constraints, and post-incident evidence updates.

   - **Safety, Availability, and Recovery Constraints** - identify where cyber controls must be adapted for safety, uptime, legacy devices, maintenance windows, physical process constraints, and manual fallback.

   - **AI-in-OT Considerations** - if AI is present, assess governance, testing, safety controls, monitoring, human oversight, and failsafe mechanisms. If AI is not present, record that this section is not applicable and list trigger conditions for reassessment.

   - **ISM and E8 Cross-Reference** - show where OT findings reuse or qualify existing AUE8 and AUISM evidence.

   - **Operations, CMDB, and Traceability Integration** - map OT components to `/arckit:servicenow` CMDB CIs and support workflows; map findings to `/arckit:risk`, `/arckit:traceability`, `/arckit:graph-report`, and `/arckit:maturity-model` outputs.

   - **Recommendations** - prioritised actions grouped by Immediate, 30-90 days, 90-180 days, and strategic uplift. Each action must identify owner, evidence artefact, and residual risk.

7. Populate the External References section per `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/references/citation-instructions.md`. ASD OT guidance documents and the verification date MUST appear in the Document Register.

8. Write the artefact via the Write tool to `projects/<project-id>/<filename>`.

9. Show only a summary to the user: overall OT posture, highest-risk connectivity gaps, and the top five recommended actions.

## Important Notes

- Essential Eight was not designed specifically for OT environments. Use E8 as enterprise baseline evidence, but document OT-specific constraints and compensating controls rather than forcing IT assumptions onto safety-critical systems.
- ISM applies to information technology and operational technology systems. Cross-reference AUISM for control evidence wherever possible.
- Treat ArcKit diagrams, DFDs, data models, ServiceNow/CMDB records, risk registers, traceability matrices, graph-report coverage, and maturity assessments as first-class evidence. If an artefact is absent, record the gap and recommend the next ArcKit command.
- OT safety and availability may override normal enterprise IT patching and change windows. Record compensating controls and residual risk explicitly.
- Direct internet exposure, unmanaged vendor remote access, undocumented radio links, flat OT networks, and obsolete boundary devices are high-risk patterns that must be called out.
- SOCI/CIRMP applicability is handled by `/arckit:au-soci-cirmp`; this command supplies OT cyber evidence that may feed that artefact.
- Keep this artefact cross-sector. Record sector-specific obligations, regulators, and assurance schemes in the relevant sector overlay or custom command.

## Suggested Next Steps

After completing this command, consider running:

- `/arckit-diagram` -- Architecture diagrams provide the authoritative context, container, deployment, and trust-boundary views for the OT environment.
- `/arckit-dfd` -- DFDs make OT data flows, protocols, stores, and cross-boundary transfers explicit for cyber and safety review.
- `/arckit-data-model` -- Data model evidence identifies OT telemetry, event, asset, and personal-information entities that need classification and retention controls.
- `/arckit-au-e8-posture` -- Essential Eight provides the enterprise cyber baseline; OT controls should document where E8 does not directly fit OT constraints.
- `/arckit-au-ism-controls` -- ISM is the broader ASD control set covering IT and OT systems; this assessment maps OT-specific evidence back to ISM domains.
- `/arckit-au-soci-cirmp` -- OT security evidence may support SOCI CIRMP cyber and information security hazard treatment for critical infrastructure assets.
- `/arckit-servicenow` -- ServiceNow/CMDB design should consume OT component, ownership, dependency, support, and incident-routing evidence.
- `/arckit-risk` -- OT exposure, safety, availability, and remote-access gaps should feed the project risk register.
- `/arckit-traceability` -- OT findings should trace back to requirements, diagrams, DFD flows, data entities, controls, risks, and operational runbooks.
- `/arckit-maturity-model` -- Use OT security findings to assess capability maturity across architecture visibility, connectivity, monitoring, suppliers, and recovery.
- `/arckit-graph-report` -- Graph reporting should show AUOT coverage alongside AU compliance, architecture, risk, traceability, and operations artefacts.
