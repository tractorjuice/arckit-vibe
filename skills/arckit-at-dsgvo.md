> ⚠️ **Community-contributed command** — not part of the officially-maintained ArcKit baseline. Output should be reviewed by qualified DSB-Beauftragter / DPO / Rechtsabteilung before reliance. Citations to Datenschutzbehörde (DSB) / EU regulations may lag the current text — verify against the source. Some citations are marked `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` and should be confirmed by an Austrian data protection practitioner before external use.

You are helping an enterprise architect generate an **Austrian Data Protection Assessment** — the Austrian-specific GDPR layer applied by the Datenschutzbehörde (DSB) under the Datenschutzgesetz (DSG 2018, BGBl. I Nr. 165/1999 as amended). Run this after `/arckit:eu-rgpd` to add Austrian obligations that go beyond the EU GDPR baseline.

## User Input

```text
${args}
```

## Instructions

> **Note**: Before generating, scan `projects/` for existing project directories. For each project, list all `ARC-*.md` artifacts, check `external/` for reference documents, and check `000-global/` for cross-project policies. If no external docs exist but they would improve output, ask the user.

### Step 0: Read existing artifacts from the project context

**MANDATORY** (warn if missing):

- **DATA** (Data Model) — Extract: all entities with personal data, special category data (besondere Kategorien), data subjects, data flows, retention periods, third-party processors
  - If missing: warn that an AT DSG assessment requires a data model to identify personal data categories
- **RGPD** (EU RGPD Assessment) — Extract: legal basis mapping, DPIA screening results, DPO determination, international transfer analysis
  - If missing: warn that `/arckit:at-dsgvo` should be run after `/arckit:eu-rgpd` for best results. Proceed with available data.

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):

- **REQ** (Requirements) — Extract: data requirements (DR-xxx), compliance requirements, authentication requirements (Bürgerkarte / Handy-Signatur / ID Austria integration)
- **STKE** (Stakeholder Analysis) — Extract: data subject categories (especially minors, patients, employees covered by ArbVG co-determination)

**OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently):

- **SECD** (Secure by Design) — Extract: security measures relevant to Art. 32 GDPR assessment
- **RISK** (Risk Register) — Extract: existing privacy-related risks for cross-reference

### Step 0b: Read external documents and policies

- Read any **external documents** in `external/` — extract previous DSB correspondence, Verarbeitungsverzeichnis (Art. 30 ROPA), existing Auftragsverarbeitungsverträge (DPAs), Betriebsvereinbarungen for employee data
- Read any **global policies** in `000-global/policies/` — extract Datenschutzerklärung, data retention schedule, DSB-Meldungen policy
- If a prior DSB assessment or Datenschutzerklärung is found, use it to pre-populate compliance status and identify gaps.

### Step 1: Identify or Create Project

Identify the target project from the hook context. If the project doesn't exist:

1. Use Glob to list `projects/*/` directories and find the highest `NNN-*` number
2. Calculate the next number (zero-padded to 3 digits)
3. Slugify the project name
4. Use the Write tool to create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/README.md`
5. Set `PROJECT_ID` and `PROJECT_PATH`

### Step 2: Read Source Artifacts

Read all documents from Step 0. Identify:

- Presence of health data (Gesundheitsdaten) → triggers §§12–13 DSG + ELGA interop section
- Image/video processing (Bildverarbeitung, CCTV) → triggers §§12–13 DSG special regime
- Employee data processing → triggers ArbVG §96a Betriebsvereinbarung requirement
- Scientific research → triggers §§7–8 DSG (Forschungszwecke) with §2d DSG opinion possibility
- Minors as data subjects → triggers §4(4) DSG (AT age of digital consent: **14 years**)
- Third-party processors in non-EEA → triggers TIA with DSB transfer focus

### Step 3: Template Reading

**Read the template** (with user override support):

- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/at-dsgvo-template.md` exists in the project root
- **If found**: Read the user's customized template
- **If not found**: Read `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/templates/at-dsgvo-template.md`

### Step 4: Generate AT Data Protection Assessment

**CRITICAL**: Use the **Write tool** to create the assessment document.

1. **Detect version**: Check for existing `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ATDSG-v*.md` files:
   - No existing file → VERSION="1.0"
   - Existing file → minor increment if refreshed, major if scope changed significantly

2. **Auto-populate Document Control**:
   - Document ID: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ATDSG-v{VERSION}`
   - Status: DRAFT
   - Created Date: {current_date}
   - Next Review Date: {current_date + 12 months}
   - Classification: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE (privacy assessments contain sensitive risk information)
   - Add note: "This document supplements ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-RGPD-v*.md with Austrian/DSB-specific requirements"

3. **Section 1: AT DSG Regulatory Framework**
   - Applicable texts table: DSGVO (EU 2016/679), DSG (BGBl. I 165/1999 idgF), sector laws (ELGA-G for health, StPO §§134–143b for law enforcement, GTelG 2012, ArbVG §96a)
   - DSB as supervisory authority — contact: dsb.gv.at
   - Austrian age of digital consent: **14 years** (§4(4) DSG, lower than GDPR default 16) — flag if minors in scope
   - Parallel BVwG (Bundesverwaltungsgericht) review pathway for DSB decisions `[NEEDS VERIFICATION: confirm current venue rules]`

4. **Section 2: §§12–13 DSG — Image and Video Processing** (conditional — only if CCTV/imagery detected)
   - §12 DSG specific lawfulness grounds for image processing (additional to Art. 6 GDPR)
   - §13 DSG labelling obligation (Kennzeichnungspflicht) — visible notice with responsible controller
   - Retention limit: 72 hours default unless justified documented exception
   - Prohibition of covert imaging except narrow statutory cases
   - DSB Musterleitfaden Bildverarbeitung applicability `[NEEDS VERIFICATION: confirm current guidance version]`
   - If no image processing: include section header with "N/A — no image or video processing identified"

5. **Section 3: Health Data and ELGA** (conditional — only if health data detected)
   - Elektronische Gesundheitsakte (ELGA-G) interoperability requirements
   - GTelG 2012 telematics interop for data exchange between health providers
   - Art. 9(2) GDPR legal basis selection — in AT typically §§7–8 DSG + ELGA-G
   - DPIA mandatory flag: special category data + large scale → run `/arckit:dpia`
   - Opt-out vs opt-in for ELGA participation — controller's integration obligations
   - If no health data: include section header with "N/A — no health data identified"

6. **Section 4: Employee Data (Arbeitnehmerdatenschutz)** (conditional — only if employee data in scope)
   - ArbVG §96a Betriebsvereinbarung requirement for any system that enables employee monitoring `[NEEDS VERIFICATION: confirm exact §96a(1) sub-point and threshold]`
   - Works council (Betriebsrat) co-determination rights
   - Data Protection Impact Assessment interface with co-determination
   - Distinction: systems touching "personal dignity" need Betriebsvereinbarung regardless of privacy level
   - If out of scope: include section header with "N/A — no employee data or no employee monitoring potential"

7. **Section 5: Scientific Research (§§7–8 DSG)** (conditional — only if research use case)
   - Research exemptions under §§7–8 DSG and Art. 89 GDPR
   - Option to request DSB opinion under §2d DSG `[NEEDS VERIFICATION: confirm current §2d text and practice]`
   - Pseudonymisation obligations
   - Retention under research framework
   - If not applicable: include section header with "N/A — no scientific research processing identified"

8. **Section 6: Data Subject Rights (Austrian enforcement)**
   - Standard rights table (Art. 15–22 GDPR) with DSB response deadlines
   - AT practice: DSB emphasises written response quality and timeliness
   - Remedy path: complaint to DSB → appeal BVwG → VwGH/VfGH
   - Right to copy of data — DSB interpretation tends to favour broad scope `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]`

9. **Section 7: DSB Reporting and Registration**
   - Art. 30 GDPR ROPA (Verarbeitungsverzeichnis) — DSB has a documented expectation of depth
   - DPO (Datenschutzbeauftragter) mandatory triggers:
     - Public authority / public body → always mandatory
     - Large-scale systematic monitoring
     - Large-scale special category data processing
   - DPO contact reporting to DSB via dsb.gv.at portal
   - No general AT-specific registration obligation beyond EU GDPR (DSG abolished the former Datenverarbeitungsregister in 2018)

10. **Section 8: Breach Notification to DSB**
    - 72-hour notification via dsb.gv.at online form
    - Individual notification for high-risk breaches
    - Breach register maintenance requirement
    - AT enforcement practice on breach late-notification penalties `[NEEDS VERIFICATION: recent DSB penalty cases]`

11. **Section 9: International Transfers (AT context)**
    - Post-Schrems II Transfer Impact Assessment requirement — align with EDPB Recommendations 01/2020
    - EU-US Data Privacy Framework status and AT implications
    - DSB position on SCC supplementary measures `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]`

12. **Section 10: DSB Enforcement Priorities and Gap Analysis**
    - Map against DSB recent enforcement focus (cookie consent, tracking, CCTV retention, employee monitoring, HR data) `[NEEDS VERIFICATION: cite recent DSB annual report]`
    - Notable AT reference decisions for calibration `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]`
    - Consolidate gaps from all sections
    - Priority based on DSB enforcement priority and legal obligation level

3. {If no eu-rgpd baseline: Run /arckit:eu-rgpd first}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Important Notes

- **Run after eu-rgpd**: This command adds the Austrian layer on top of the EU GDPR baseline. For best results, run `/arckit:eu-rgpd` first, then this command.
- **Austrian age of digital consent is 14, not 16**: Austria chose the lower limit allowed by GDPR (§4(4) DSG). Do not apply the GDPR default of 16.
- **§§12–13 DSG on image processing is unique**: AT retained a standalone image-processing regime when harmonising with GDPR, with specific labelling and retention rules. This is not covered by the EU GDPR baseline and must be assessed separately if any CCTV/imagery is in scope.
- **ArbVG §96a Betriebsvereinbarung is separate from GDPR**: Employee monitoring capability requires a works-council agreement even where GDPR lawfulness is established. Flag if employee monitoring is possible.
- **Verify citations**: Austrian data protection practice evolves through DSB decisions and BVwG case law. Items marked `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` must be confirmed against current DSB guidance before external use.
- **Use Write Tool**: AT DSG assessments cover multiple Austrian-specific regulations and are typically 2,000–4,000 words. Always use the Write tool.

## Example Usage

```text
/arckit:at-dsgvo Austrian DSG layer for 001 — federal ministry HR system with CCTV at entrances, employee data, and potential monitoring of IT usage

/arckit:at-dsgvo Assess AT DSG obligations for a Vienna regional hospital group integrating with ELGA, processing Gesundheitsdaten, planning mobile patient portal

```

## Suggested Next Steps

After completing this command, consider running:

- `/arckit-dpia` -- Run a full Data Protection Impact Assessment if AT DSB screening flags high risk *(when 2+ AT DPIA criteria triggered or DSB published Blacklist applies)*
- `/arckit-eu-rgpd` -- Run the pan-EU GDPR baseline first if not already completed *(when No prior eu-rgpd assessment exists for this project)*
- `/arckit-at-nisg` -- Assess NISG obligations where personal data is processed by Essential/Important entities *(when Entity potentially qualifies as Essential or Important under NISG)*
