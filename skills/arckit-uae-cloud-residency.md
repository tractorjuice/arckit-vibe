You are an enterprise architect assessing UAE sovereign cloud residency under the National Cloud Security Policy v2.

## Process

1. Read prerequisites:
   - `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` (federal principles, if present)
   - The project's Smart Data Classification Register (`ARC-<project-id>-CLAS-v*.md`). If missing, halt and instruct the user to run `/arckit:uae-classification` first.
   - The project's REQ, ARCH, and IAS artefacts (if present)
   - `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/templates/_partials/RENDERING.md`
2. Read the template:
   - **First**, check `.arckit/templates-custom/uae-cloud-residency-template.md` (user override)
   - **Then**, `.arckit/templates/uae-cloud-residency-template.md`
   - **Fallback**, `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/templates/uae-cloud-residency-template.md`
3. Use `scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh CRES --filename` for the artefact filename.
4. Resolve the `<!-- DOC-CONTROL-HEADER -->` marker per `RENDERING.md`.
5. Generate:
   - **Scope** — services in scope, dependencies on other services' residency posture, shared platform components (identity, observability, backups).
   - **Per-Dataset Residency Assessment** — for each Dataset ID from the CLAS register, map Classification → Required residency → Chosen CSP → Region → Compliance check. Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret datasets MUST resolve to UAE-resident sovereign infrastructure under the National Cloud Security Policy v2.
   - **CSP Due-Diligence Pack** — for each candidate CSP (Core42 / G42 sovereign cloud, Microsoft UAE North and UAE Central, TDRA FedNet, e& Sovereign Launchpad on AWS), record certification posture (DESC for Dubai entities, CSC accreditation), regional footprint, sovereign-data scope, and any documented limitations.
   - **Shared-Responsibility Matrix** — per chosen CSP, division of security responsibilities across infrastructure, platform, application, data, identity, and operational layers.
   - **Exit and Portability Plan** — data egress strategy, format portability, identity migration, key custody on exit, contingency residency on regulatory change.
6. Populate the External References section per `${VIBE_EXTENSION_ROOT}/references/citation-instructions.md`. The National Cloud Security Policy v2 MUST appear in the Document Register with its primary URL and the verification date.
7. Write the artefact via the Write tool to `projects/<project-id>/<filename>`.
8. Show only a summary to the user (paragraph plus headline counts: datasets requiring UAE residency, datasets compliant, datasets non-compliant, chosen CSPs).

## Authoritative anchor

UAE National Cloud Security Policy v2, published by the UAE Cybersecurity Council. Primary URL: <https://csc.gov.ae/documents/38662/489552/National+Cloud+Security+Policy_V2.0.pdf>

## Important notes

- Confidential / Secret / Top Secret data MUST be hosted on UAE-resident infrastructure. Flag any non-compliant dataset as a critical gap and recommend either re-classification (with rationale) or migration.
- DESC accreditation is Dubai-specific; federal entities may rely on CSC accreditation. Both should be recorded where applicable.
- Each material residency decision (chosen CSP, region, derogation) should be captured as a formal ADR — see the `adr` handoff.

## Suggested Next Steps

After completing this command, consider running:

- `/arckit-uae-classification` -- This command depends on the Smart Data Classification Register — run uae-classification first if it does not yet exist. *(when No CLAS artefact present in the project)*
- `/arckit-adr` -- Capture each material residency decision (chosen CSP, region, derogations) as a formal ADR.
