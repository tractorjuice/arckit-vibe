| Information systems | [List IS covered] | [List IS explicitly excluded] |
| Sites and locations | [Sites covered] | [Sites excluded] |
| Users | [All staff / specific categories] | [External parties under their own PSSI] |
| Partner systems | [Interconnected systems assessed via EBIOS] | [Partner-owned systems not connected] |

### 1.3 Relationship with Other Documents

Based on the EBIOS Risk Manager study [reference document], the main threats identified are:

| Threat | Source | Potential Impact |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| [e.g. Ransomware attack] | Cybercriminals | Availability, data confidentiality |
| [e.g. Data exfiltration] | Nation-state actors | Confidentiality of sensitive data |
| [e.g. Insider threat] | Malicious or negligent staff | Integrity, availability |

## 3. Security Objectives

### 3.1 Security Principles

This PSSI is founded on the following principles:

| # | Principle | Description |
|---|-----------|------------|
| P-01 | Need-to-know | Access to information is granted only when there is a demonstrated operational need |
| P-02 | Least privilege | Users and systems operate with the minimum privileges required for their function |
| P-03 | Defence in depth | Security controls are layered — no single control is relied upon exclusively |
| P-04 | Separation of duties | Critical functions require involvement of multiple independent actors |
| P-05 | Traceability | All access to sensitive information is logged and attributable to an individual |
| P-06 | Proportionality | Security measures are proportionate to the value of assets and level of risk |
| P-07 | Continuity | Security measures are designed to maintain mission continuity under degraded conditions |
| P-08 | Resilience | Systems are designed to detect, resist, and recover from security incidents |

### 3.2 Security Objectives by Property

| Security Property | Objective | RGS Level |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Confidentiality | Ensure that information is accessible only to authorised persons | [★ / ★★ / ★★★] |
| Integrity | Ensure that information is accurate and has not been tampered with | [★ / ★★ / ★★★] |
| Availability | Ensure that information systems are available when needed | [★ / ★★ / ★★★] |
| Traceability | Ensure that all operations on information can be traced and attributed | [★ / ★★ / ★★★] |
| Authentication | Ensure that the identity of users and systems is verified | [★ / ★★ / ★★★] |
