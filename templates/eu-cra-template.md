## 1. Scope and Classification

### 1.1 In-Scope Assessment

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| Product with digital elements (hardware or software) | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| Placed or made available on EU market | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| Excluded category (medical devices, aviation, automotive, marine, civil aviation regulated by sector law) | ☐ Yes ☐ No — if yes, check sector regulation |

**CRA In Scope**: ☐ Yes ☐ No

### 1.2 Risk Classification

| Class | Annex | Description | Examples | Conformity Route |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Default** | — | All products not in Class I or II | Most software, consumer IoT | Internal self-assessment |
| **Important (Class I)** | Annex III, Part I | Higher cybersecurity risk | Identity management software, browsers, password managers, VPNs, network monitoring, industrial control systems, smart home security | Self-assessment with harmonised standards |
| **Critical (Class II)** | Annex III, Part II | Highest cybersecurity risk | HSMs, secure elements, smart meters, critical infrastructure components, industrial automation, card readers | Third-party assessment (notified body) |

**Product Classification**: ☐ Default | ☐ Important (Class I) | ☐ Critical (Class II)

### 1.3 Open Source Assessment

| Scenario | CRA Applicability |
|---------|-----------------|
| Purely open source, no commercial activity | Out of scope |
| Open source with paid support/services | In scope for supported product |
| Integrating open source in commercial product | In scope — manufacturer responsible for full product |
| Open source foundation / steward | Lighter obligations (security policies, CVE participation) |

**Open source scenario**: [Scenario] | **CRA applicability**: [Yes / No / Partial]

## 2. Security Requirements by Design (Annex I, Part I)

| Requirement | Description | Status | Gap | Remediation |
|-------------|-------------|--------|-----|-------------|

| Secure by default configuration | Products delivered with secure default settings, no unnecessary features enabled | ☐ | | |
| Protection against unauthorised access | Authentication, access control, attack surface reduction | ☐ | | |
| Data confidentiality and integrity | Encryption of data at rest and in transit | ☐ | | |
| Minimal data collection | Process only data strictly necessary for intended purpose | ☐ | | |
| Availability protection | Measures against DoS attacks | ☐ | | |
| Limit attack surface | Disable unused interfaces; minimise exposed components | ☐ | | |
| Reduce exploitable vulnerabilities | Least privilege, defence in depth, secure coding | ☐ | | |
| Integrity monitoring | Verify integrity of software and data | ☐ | | |
| Security audit logging | Log security-relevant events, tamper-resistant logs | ☐ | | |
| Secure update mechanism | Signed updates, rollback capability | ☐ | | |
