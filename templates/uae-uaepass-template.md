## Executive Summary

[Two to three paragraphs describing the service's UAE Pass integration posture: which user journeys authenticate with UAE Pass, the chosen profile mix (Basic vs Verified), and any e-signature obligations.]

## Scope

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Federal entity (Service Provider) | [name] |
| In-scope user journeys | [list] |
| User populations | [citizens / residents / visitors / employees] |
| Out-of-scope journeys (with rationale) | [list] |
| Service Provider category (TDRA / ICP onboarding) | [Public / Private / Government] |

## Authentication Flow Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User Agent
    participant SP as Service Provider
    participant IDP as UAE Pass IdP
    U->>SP: Visit protected resource
    SP->>U: 302 redirect to /idshub/authorize (Authorization Code + PKCE)
    U->>IDP: Authorization request (client_id, scope, code_challenge)
    IDP->>U: User authenticates (mobile app push / SMS-OTP)
    IDP->>U: 302 redirect to SP callback with code
    U->>SP: GET /callback?code=...
    SP->>IDP: POST /idshub/token (code + code_verifier)
    IDP->>SP: id_token + access_token
    SP->>IDP: GET /idshub/userinfo (access_token)
    IDP->>SP: claims (sub, idn, fullnameEN, ...)
    SP->>U: Establish session, render service
```

## Profile Selection (Basic vs Verified)

| User journey | Profile required | Rationale | Upgrade path if user arrives Basic-only |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| [journey] | [Basic / Verified] | [rationale] | [redirect to UAE Pass kiosk / video-KYC URL] |

> Verified profile requires prior Emirates ID verification. Basic profile is sufficient for read-only and low-assurance journeys; Verified is required for KYC-bound transactions and for any flow that uses UAE Pass e-signature.

## Claim Mapping

| UAE Pass claim | SP user-record field | Required? | Consent / privacy note |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| `sub` | `external_subject_id` | Y | Stable subject identifier — primary join key |
| `idn` (Emirates ID) | `emirates_id` | [Y/N] | Personal data — PDPL Article 5 lawful basis required |
| `fullnameEN` | `name_en` | [Y/N] | [note] |
| `fullnameAR` | `name_ar` | [Y/N] | [note] |
| `mobile` | `mobile` | [Y/N] | [note] |
| `email` | `email` | [Y/N] | [note] |
| `nationalityEN` | `nationality_en` | [Y/N] | [note] |
| `nationalityAR` | `nationality_ar` | [Y/N] | [note] |
| `gender` | `gender` | [Y/N] | [note] |
| `dob` | `date_of_birth` | [Y/N] | Sensitive — minimise retention |
| `profileType` | `uaepass_profile_type` | Y | Discriminates Basic vs Verified |

## Service Provider Onboarding Checklist

## E-signature Audit Trail Design

For every journey that invokes the UAE Pass e-signature endpoint, record:

| Field | Source | Storage | Retention |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Signed document hash | SP-computed (SHA-256) before signing request | [WORM store / records system] | [period] |
| Signed document (PDF/A) | UAE Pass signing response | [WORM store] | [period] |
| Signer subject identifier (`sub`) | UAE Pass `id_token` | [audit log] | [period] |
| Emirates ID (`idn`) | UAE Pass `id_token` (Verified only) | [audit log — encrypted] | [period] |
| Signature timestamp | UAE Pass response | [audit log] | [period] |
| Certificate chain | UAE Pass response | [audit log] | [period] |
| User consent artefact | SP-captured before signing | [audit log] | [period] |

State the legal-effect citation supporting non-repudiation of the signed artefact under UAE law.
