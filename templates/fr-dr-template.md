## Revision History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes | Approved By | Approval Date |

## Scope Statement

> **Important distinction**: This assessment covers the **Diffusion Restreinte (DR)** mention only. DR is an administrative protection mention governed by II 901/SGDSN/ANSSI for electronic systems. It is **not** a classification level under IGI 1300 (which covers Confidentiel Défense and above). Systems handling IGI 1300 classified information require a separate defence security framework beyond the scope of this assessment.

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| System assessed | [System name and description] |
| DR assets identified | [N document types / data categories] |
| Production entity | [Ministry / Directorate / Agency] |
| Receiving entities | [List of authorised recipients] |
| Electronic systems in scope | [IS name(s) hosting DR documents] |

---

## 1. DR Asset Inventory

Identify all information assets produced, processed, or transmitted by the system that carry or should carry the DR mention.

| ID | Asset / Document Type | Origin | Volume (est.) | Current Classification | Should Be DR |
|----|----------------------|--------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| DR-DOC-01 | [e.g. Internal security reports] | [Directorate X] | [~N/month] | [Unclassified / DR] | [Yes / No] |
| DR-DOC-02 | [e.g. Audit findings] | | | | |

**DR marking criteria**: Apply DR when unauthorised disclosure would harm the interests of the French State or a third party, without reaching the level requiring formal classification under IGI 1300.
