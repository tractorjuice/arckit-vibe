## Revision History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes | Approved By | Approval Date |
|---------|------|--------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| [VERSION] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit:uae-cloud-residency` | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |

## Executive Summary

[Two to three paragraphs describing the residency posture, the chosen sovereign cloud combination, residual non-compliance (if any), and the exit / portability stance under the UAE National Cloud Security Policy v2.]

## Scope

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Services in scope | [list] |
| Upstream dependencies | [services / platforms] |
| Downstream dependencies | [services / platforms] |
| Shared platform components | [identity / observability / backup / secrets / etc.] |
| Out-of-scope (with rationale) | [list] |

## Per-Dataset Residency Assessment

For each Dataset ID from the project's Smart Data Classification Register (`ARC-<project-id>-CLAS-v*.md`), assess required and actual residency.

| Dataset ID | Classification | Required residency | Chosen CSP | Region | Compliance check |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| [DS-001] | [Open / Shared / Confidential / Secret / Top Secret] | [UAE-resident / no constraint] | [Core42 / G42 / Microsoft UAE North / UAE Central / FedNet / e& Sovereign Launchpad / etc.] | [region] | [Compliant / Non-compliant — rationale] |

> Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret datasets MUST resolve to UAE-resident sovereign infrastructure under the National Cloud Security Policy v2. Any non-compliant row is a critical gap.

## CSP Due-Diligence Pack

For each candidate CSP, record the diligence posture.

### TDRA FedNet

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|

| Documented limitations | [notes] |

> Add additional candidate CSPs (e.g. Oracle UAE, Google Cloud) using the same pattern.

## Shared-Responsibility Matrix

For the chosen CSP combination, record the division of security responsibilities.

| Layer | CSP responsibility | Customer responsibility | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Physical and environmental | [scope] | [scope] | [notes] |
| Infrastructure (compute / storage / network) | [scope] | [scope] | [notes] |
| Platform (managed services) | [scope] | [scope] | [notes] |
| Application | [scope] | [scope] | [notes] |
| Data and encryption keys | [scope] | [scope] | [notes — BYOK / HYOK / customer-managed] |
| Identity and access | [scope] | [scope] | [notes — UAE PASS / federation] |
| Operations and monitoring | [scope] | [scope] | [notes] |

## Exit and Portability Plan

| Item | Plan |
|------|------|
| Data egress strategy | [export format, mechanism, owner] |
| Format portability | [open formats / proprietary mitigations] |
| Identity migration | [plan] |
| Encryption key custody on exit | [HSM transfer / re-wrap / re-key] |
