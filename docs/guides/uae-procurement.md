# UAE Federal Procurement Strategy Playbook

> **Guide Origin**: Community | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:uae-procurement` generates a federal procurement strategy under UAE Federal Decree-Law No. 11 of 2023 on Procurements in the Federal Government. Produces ITT / RFP packs aligned with the Ministry of Finance Digital Procurement Platform (DPP) templates, an In-Country Value (ICV) plan, the evaluation report structure, and the contract register.

|---------|----------|
| Procurement Strategy | Route to market, lot structure, contract type, term, options |

## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Strategic case | Business case and budget | `/arckit:sobc` |
| Procurement | Strategy + ITT / RFP pack + ICV | `/arckit:uae-procurement` |
| Market | Vendor research and shortlist | `/arckit:research` |
| Evaluation | Formal supplier evaluation | `/arckit:evaluate` |

---

## Review Checklist

- Route to market matches Decree-Law 11/2023 thresholds and exemption criteria.
- ITT / RFP follows DPP template sections (no custom annexes that conflict with DPP requirements).
- ICV target is stated with measurement methodology.
- Evaluation weights add to 100% and are pre-published.
- Mandatory criteria (pass / fail) listed before scored criteria.
- Contract register schema captures KPIs and penalty regime.
- Procurement strategy and ICV plan handed off to SOBC.

---

## Key Notes

- **DPP alignment**: All federal procurements above threshold are run through the MoF Digital Procurement Platform — the ITT / RFP pack must conform to DPP templates.
- **ICV is mandatory**: In-Country Value scoring is non-optional for many federal procurements — define the target before going to market.
- **Evaluation parity**: Use `/arckit:evaluate` to drive the formal supplier evaluation against the methodology defined here.
- **Community-contributed**: Output should be reviewed by qualified federal procurement counsel before reliance.
