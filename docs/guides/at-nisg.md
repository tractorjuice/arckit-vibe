# Austrian NIS Act (NISG) Compliance Playbook

> **Guide Origin**: Community | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:at-nisg` assesses Austrian NISG obligations (BGBl. I Nr. 94/2025) — the Austrian transposition of NIS2. Covers Essential / Important entity classification, BKA (GovCERT) and BMI (SPOC) reporting, KSÖ coordination, and Austrian sectoral rules.

> **Run after** `/arckit:eu-nis2` — this command supplements the EU NIS2 baseline with Austrian transposition specifics.

## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| EU baseline | NIS2 compliance | `/arckit:eu-nis2` |
| Austrian layer | NISG-specific assessment | `/arckit:at-nisg` |
| Risk | Surface gaps to risk register | `/arckit:risk` |
| Controls | Implement Article 21 measures | `/arckit:secure` |
| Procurement | Supply-chain clauses | `/arckit:at-bvergg` |

## Review Checklist

- EU NIS2 baseline (`ARC-<id>-NIS2-v*.md`) completed first.
- Entity classification (Essential vs Important) is explicit with sectoral basis.
- All 10 Article 21 measures assessed (no skipped rows).
- BKA / GovCERT reporting pathway has named owner and incident-class triggers.
- BMI SPOC registration status and contact maintenance documented.
- Supply-chain clauses fed to procurement (`/arckit:at-bvergg`).
- Gaps surfaced to project risk register.

## Key Notes

- **Recent legislation**: NISG idF BGBl. I Nr. 94/2025 is recent and evolving — items marked `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` must be confirmed against the current text and implementing ordinances before external use.
- **Sectoral overlay**: Some sectors (energy, transport, finance, health) have additional Austrian rules above NIS2 — confirm sectoral scope.
- **Run order**: Supplements `/arckit:eu-nis2`. Do not run in isolation.
- **Community-contributed**: Output should be reviewed by qualified CISO / BMI-liaison / Rechtsabteilung before reliance.
