## Review Checklist

- Lawful basis recorded for every processing activity (no "TBD").
- Data subject rights workflow has named owner and SLA.
- DPIA screen completed; high-risk processing has documented mitigations.
- Cross-border transfers logged with adequacy / safeguard mechanism.
- Breach playbook names the UAE Data Office notification window.
- DPIA outputs handed off to the project risk register.
- Smart Data Classification Register reconciled against PDPL-relevant datasets.

## Key Notes

- **Executive Regulation**: PDPL Executive Regulation is flagged as `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` in the overlay maintenance log — confirm current status before publication.
- **Cross-border**: Default position is sovereign UAE residency for Confidential and above; transfers require explicit derogation.
- **Run order**: Best executed after `/arckit:uae-classification` so PDPL-relevant datasets are already tagged.
- **Community-contributed**: Output should be reviewed by qualified DPO / federal compliance counsel before reliance.
