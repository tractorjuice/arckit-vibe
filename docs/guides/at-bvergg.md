## Strategy Structure

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| Scope and Threshold Determination | Oberschwellen vs Unterschwellen calculation against current EU thresholds |
| Procurement Procedure Selection | Open / restricted / negotiated / competitive dialogue / innovation partnership |
| ANKÖ Publication Plan | Notice timing, language, content per BVergG §§ |
| Award Criteria | Mandatory / quality / price weights and scoring rubric |
| BVergGVS Secondary Rules | Defence / security / utilities / concessions where applicable |
| Vendor Security & Data-Protection Clauses | DSGVO processor clauses, NISG supply-chain clauses |
| BVwG Review Pathway | Standstill, pre-review request, BVwG appeal route and timing |
| External References | BVergG 2018 + EU directive transposition citations |

---

## Threshold Reference

| Tier | Trigger |
|------|---------|
| Oberschwellen | Above EU threshold — full BVergG regime, ANKÖ publication, EU OJ |
| Unterschwellen | Below EU threshold — lighter regime, national publication |

> EU thresholds are updated every two years — confirm the current value against the latest EU threshold regulation.

## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Strategic case | Business case and budget | `/arckit:sobc` |
| Compliance pre-checks | Personal data + critical-entity status | `/arckit:at-dsgvo`, `/arckit:at-nisg` |
| Procurement | BVergG strategy + tender pack | `/arckit:at-bvergg` |
| Evaluation | Score vendor responses | `/arckit:evaluate` |
| Traceability | Link procurement requirements back | `/arckit:traceability` |

## Review Checklist

- Threshold determination cites the current EU threshold regulation.
- Procurement procedure choice has documented rationale (matches BVergG criteria).
- ANKÖ publication timing, content, and language meet BVergG §§ requirements.
- Award criteria pre-published with weights summing to 100%.
- DSGVO processor clauses included where personal data is processed.
- NISG supply-chain clauses included where contracting entity is Essential / Important.
- Standstill period and BVwG review pathway documented in vendor pack.

## Key Notes

- **Threshold drift**: EU procurement thresholds change every two years — items marked `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` must be confirmed against the latest regulation before external publication.
- **Defence / utilities / concessions**: BVergGVS imposes additional rules — confirm sectoral scope before relying on the standard BVergG path.
- **Run after pre-checks**: `/arckit:at-dsgvo` and `/arckit:at-nisg` should run first if either applies — their clauses feed the vendor pack.
- **Community-contributed**: Output should be reviewed by qualified Vergabejurist / Rechtsabteilung before reliance.
