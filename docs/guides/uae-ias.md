# UAE Information Assurance Standard (IAS) Playbook

> **Guide Origin**: Community | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:uae-ias` generates a UAE IAS Statement of Applicability against the 188 controls — 60 management controls (M1–M6) plus 128 technical controls (T1–T9) — priority-tiered P1 to P4. Anchored on the UAE Cybersecurity Council Information Assurance Standard v2.

Targeted at federal entities and Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) operators.

## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Architecture | System scope and security NFRs | `/arckit:requirements`, `/arckit:platform-design` |
| IAS | Statement of Applicability + Risk Treatment Plan | `/arckit:uae-ias` |
| Residency | T-family controls into CSP / region choice | `/arckit:uae-cloud-residency` |
| Risk | Surface IAS gaps to project risk register | `/arckit:risk` |

## Review Checklist

- All 188 controls present in the Statement of Applicability.
- Each control has Applicable / Not Applicable + rationale (no blank cells).
- Priority tier (P1–P4) assigned per control.
- Gaps have a treatment option (mitigate / transfer / accept / avoid) with named owner.
- CII registration status is explicit (registered / pending / not designated).
- T-family gaps that constrain residency choice flagged for `/arckit:uae-cloud-residency`.

## Key Notes

- **CII status**: Designation as Critical Information Infrastructure changes priority profile and obligations. Confirm with the Cybersecurity Council before relying on the SoA.
- **Audit cadence**: IAS expects independent assessment on a defined cycle — capture the next assessment date in Document Control.
- **Run order**: Run after the security architecture is stable; rerun on material architecture changes.
- **Community-contributed**: Output should be reviewed by qualified RSSI / federal compliance counsel before reliance.
