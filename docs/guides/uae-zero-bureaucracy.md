## Review Checklist

- Every service in scope mapped to a Code for Government Services entry.
- Baseline (steps, documents, time) captured for "before" and "after".
- KPIs have measurable targets (no qualitative-only goals).
- Each Code clause has an explicit compliance statement (compliant / partial / non-compliant + plan).
- Bureaucracy-elimination outcomes feed `/arckit:uae-priorities-alignment`.

---

## Key Notes

- **Programme alignment**: Outputs feed the federal Zero Bureaucracy reporting cadence.
- **Baseline first**: Capture the "before" measurement explicitly — improvement claims require it.
- **Run order**: Best executed once user stories and journeys are stable.
- **Community-contributed**: Output should be reviewed by qualified service-design and federal compliance counsel before reliance.
