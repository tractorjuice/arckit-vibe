# IRN — Indice de Résilience Numérique Playbook

> **Guide Origin**: Community | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:fr-irn` structures an **IRN (Indice de Résilience Numérique)** self-assessment following the aDRI framework — 8 resilience pillars, with criteria assessed per digital asset or organisation-wide, a maturity scaffold and handoff to the official aDRI methodology.

> **Why reference instead of reproduce**: The IRN scoring criteria are published under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (non-commercial, no derivatives), which is incompatible with ArcKit's MIT licence (commercial use permitted). Additionally, the IRN is a living standard that evolves at [gitlab.com/digitalresilienceinitiative/adri-irn](https://gitlab.com/digitalresilienceinitiative/adri-irn) — embedding a snapshot would diverge from the official methodology. ArcKit structures and documents your assessment; the aDRI repository provides the scoring criteria.

## The 8 IRN Pillars

| Code | Pillar | Thematic Areas |
|------|--------|---------------|
| RES-1 | Résilience Stratégique | Vision & roadmap, independence strategy, IT governance |
| RES-2 | Résilience Économique et Juridique | Regulatory compliance (RGPD, AI Act, DORA, NIS2…), legal sovereignty |
| RES-3 | Résilience Data & IA | Data control, AI infrastructure, ethics & transparency |
| RES-4 | Résilience Opérationnelle | Business continuity, incident management, recovery plans |
| RES-5 | Résilience Supply-Chain | Critical suppliers, diversification, contracts & SLAs |
| RES-6 | Résilience Technologique | Infrastructure & cloud, applications & SaaS, open source |
| RES-7 | Sécurité & Résilience | Cybersecurity, data protection, risk management |
| RES-8 | Résilience Environnementale et Énergétique | Energy dependency, environmental hazards, carbon footprint, green IT |

## How the Grid Is Assessed (IRN v1.2)

The official workbook (`Référentiel_IRN_v1.2.xlsx`, with an `.ods` twin and an English `DRI_Referential_v_1.1.xlsx`) is filled once per **digital asset**. Since v1.0 it replaces the v0.4 questionnaire, which scored R/NR across five organisational layers.

| Element | What it means |
|---------|---------------|
| Digital asset | The unit of assessment — described by type (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, software, infrastructure…), supplier, operator, importance (Standard / Essentiel / Vital) and business use |
| Criterion | Identified `RES-N.n` under one of the 8 pillars; the list changes between versions |
| Criterion scope | **Organisation** (assessed once) or **Actif numérique** (assessed for each asset) |
| Maturity level | Recorded per criterion from the grid's own scale, or marked non-resilient or not applicable, with comments and evidence |

## What ArcKit Does vs What the Official aDRI Grid Does

| ArcKit (`/arckit:fr-irn`) | Official aDRI Grid |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Creates the document structure | Provides the criteria and maturity scale per pillar |
| Pre-populates context and the asset inventory from existing project artifacts | Defines each criterion's scope, intent and recommendations |
| Flags observable dependency risks | Records maturity level, comments and evidence per asset |
| Links to the official methodology | Issues independent certification |

---

## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | Requirements and architecture principles | `/arckit:requirements`, `/arckit:principles` |
| Security | Cybersecurity posture (feeds RES-7) | `/arckit:fr-anssi`, `/arckit:fr-ebios` |
| Cloud | Cloud sovereignty (feeds RES-6) | `/arckit:fr-secnumcloud` |
| Compliance | Regulatory compliance (feeds RES-2) | `/arckit:eu-rgpd`, `/arckit:eu-nis2` |
| IRN | Self-assessment scaffold | `/arckit:fr-irn` |
| Scoring | Apply official aDRI grid | (External — aDRI GitLab) |

## Review Checklist

- All 8 IRN pillars present as document sections.
- Digital assets in scope listed with type, supplier, operator and importance.
- Maturity-level placeholders present per criterion ID — not pre-filled by AI, criterion text not reproduced.
- Link to official aDRI evaluation grid displayed prominently.
- Licence incompatibility note and living-repo rationale included in document body.
- Scoring summary matrix (8 pillars × Organisation and each asset) present.
- Preliminary observations from project artifacts noted.
- Document classified Diffusion Restreinte.

## Key Notes

- **Not a compliance framework** — the IRN is a strategic resilience index comparable to a B Corp label for digital autonomy. It is not a regulatory requirement (unlike DORA, NIS2, RGPD) but is increasingly expected by investors, partners, and public sector procurement.
- **Scoring is external** — ArcKit creates the scaffold; the actual maturity levels require the official aDRI evaluation grid. ArcKit must not attempt to reconstruct or approximate the scoring criteria.
- **Living standard** — the IRN is under active development (current version: 1.2, published September 2026). Always download the current evaluation grid from the official repository before scoring.
- **Certification available** — organisations can request independent IRN certification via the aDRI ([thedigitalresilience.org](https://thedigitalresilience.org/)).
- **Diffusion Restreinte** — the dependency map and gap analysis reveal strategic vulnerabilities that should not be publicly disclosed.
